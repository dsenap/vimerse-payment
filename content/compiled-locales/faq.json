When you are redirected to the ordering form, you will be asked if it is your first time using our video editing service. Once you indicate that this is indeed your first time, then your submission will be free as long as raw footage does not exceed 45 minutes. If raw footage exceeds 45 minutes, there is a fee ($0.35/min) to edit additional footage unless you are a Twitch streamer. If you are a Twitch streamer, we would make a highlight for you for completely free, regardless of the stream duration. No subscription required. No watermark. No strings attached! The free trial includes one round of 30-min revision."
